# Task Countdown

Count of tasks, known to be required to progress towards a final release 2.9.0 of Riak.  The release phase is split into four parts:

- Private Release Candidate - preparing a branch which can be subject to non-production testing by the primary Riak customers involved in the development cycle.  This will allow for further testing under different constraints, and work to commence on exploiting the required features.

- Public Release Candidate - provide a release candidate that has passed sufficient testing to allow for proving in non-production environments by a broader customer base.

- Release 2.9.0 - a quality-assured first release of the series.

- Subsequent Releases - any features deferred from 2.9.0, or fixes discovered post the Release of 2.9.0 may lead to subsequent releases.

## Subsequent Releases

The main focus after release 2.9.0 will shift to Release 3.0.  The focus for Release 3.0 will be on OTP uplift and rebar3 compatibility.  There are some features which were de-prioritised during the 2.2.5 and 2.9.0 release cycles, which may yet reemerge as candidate features for 2.9.x releases:

Task | Status
:-------------------------|:-------------------------:|
Revisit coordinator only flushes - previously when testing this didn't consider handoffs | unassigned
Revisit non-primary read-repair | unassigned
Add re-replicate if clock advanced feature (so clock returned from aae_fold can remain opaque to client) | unassigned
Investigate Yokozuna [abstraction PR](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1571) | unassigned
A-D replication fixes | ongoing - bet365
